### Internship
Security Researcher at [Singularity Security Lab](https://github.com/singularseclab).

**Working on Kernel Vulnerability Exploitation and Malicious APK Analysis**
- Exploitation of a N-day data race vulnerability(CVE-2020-29660) of PTY subsystem in Linux Kernel 4.19 to achieve the privilege escalation, which can also be exploited on Android Kernel 4.4.
- Analyzing behaviors of malicious APKs using Frida and Java decompiler. Also with other researchers, establishing a run-time behavior analysis sandbox on Android 12 for unknown potential threats.
